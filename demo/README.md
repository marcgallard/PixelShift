## Why a demo section?

This section's purpose is to illustrate the features of my software and how the provided demoPic deteriorates after certain variables are tweaked in the configuration. While the current features are very basic, as my software becomes more advanced my goal is to flesh out this section to give a quick rundown to anyone curious what this software can do beyond running it themselves. 

This is designed to be pictographic in nature and as such more in-depth explanations can be found in the wiki.

Note I am using mathematical notation for range, such that [] means inclusive and () means exclusive. So a range of (-1,1] means a range of (0, 1), while a range of [-1, 1] means (-1, 0, 1).
